    "text": "How to Make It\nThis slide deck walks you through how to create your portfolio website using a open-source scientific publishing tool called Quarto. There are many different tools and platforms available and you should just pick one rather than spend too much time deliberating. However, I like Quarto for several reasons:\n\nAll the code for your website is written in Markdown.\nThe markdown format makes it very amenable to tracking in a version control tool like Git.\nYou can easily publish for free on Github Pages with a one-liner from the command line.\nQuarto handles math formatting, figure captions, and references with ease."

    "text": "Show More:\n\n\n\n\n\nRocket Launch\n\n\nWhile on Alamo Heights High School, I joined the rocketry program and worked in a project to design, build, and test a hybrid rocket. The goal was to build a hybrid rocket capable of reaching 50,000 ft while having a 5 lb payload and safely recovering it. This is not an easy task, but we were able to build a rocket and test it at White Sands Missile Range.\nThe first step was to simulate the flight and make sure the general shape and size of the rocket would be able to meet our objectives, here is a picture of the simulation we ran on Google Sheets using Euler’s method in order to predict where the rocket would end up in (Disclaimer: this simulation was modified post flight to match flight data we got, mainly as a test of the efficacy of the simulation algorithm)\n\n\n\nFlight Profile\n\n\nThis algorithm was compared to the actual flight after we added specific values from the flight in order to calculate the efficiency of the engine (Isp). This next image has a yellow line representing the actual flight path of the rocket, and there is an overlapping blue line that is what we simulated. Using the specific angle the rocket went, how high it went, and how far it landed (crashed), we determined that the Isp was around 157 seconds. We also assumed constant wind speeds for this result, but we have checked that modifying these would have minimal impact (whithin reasonable range). Another issue the rocket had is that the tank was only half full (or half empty), meaning that we also had to account for this in these simulations post flight analysis.\n\n\n\nSimulation vs Actual data\n\n\nAlthough all of this simulation was really interesting, we can now talk about the subsystem I was mainly involved in: Recovery (I think this was spoiled before, but the rocket crashed). Altough the rocket crashed, it is unclear if it was the avionics or recovery that failed, but it is more likely it would have been the avionics since not even the nosecone was able to deploy, which should be directly liable on the avionics. All of this was analysed post flight and noted for the next year in the project, where they were able to get a working recovery system. At the end of the day, having a system you can’t fully test work first time is difficult. Here is a short overview of the recovery system:\n\n\n\nRecovery system design\n\n\nThis system consisted of a dual deployment using only 1 parachute. Although we only have 1 parachute, we can make it act like 2 different sizes by using a technique called reefing, where we tie down the parachute so it is closed when it is deployed. This helps since it acts like a smaller parachute and then we can cut this line using our custom designed and built line cutters to fully open them. For this, we tested the line cutters before flight, which we can see in the video below:\n\n\nVideo\nLine cutter test\n\n\nFinally, this recovery system and the other components of the rocket were integrated, amking sure they all worked together in order to achieve the video shown, The rocket was 63kg dry mass and 95kg wet mass (with fuel and oxidizer), although designed to be 113kg: The rocket reached a total altitude over ground level of 18994 feet (5774 meters).\n\n\nVideo\nRocket Flight"

    "text": "Finding the area under a hyperbola using rotations.\n\n\n Show More:\n\n\n\n\n\nRotated Hyperbola with Areas\n\n\nBy only knowing that the integral of 1/x is ln|x| and how to use polar equations (or Euler’s formula), it is possible to find the integral of a hyperbola. This isn’t normally seen up until Calculus II. The Integral (Area under the curve) of y^2 - x^2 = 2 was calculated through the 45° rotation of a y=1/x graph and finding the areas composing it on the graph. This approach clearly shows why the area under a hyperbola depends on a natural logarithm and other properties it has. Here is an interactive representation of this process\nHyperbolas are interesting shapes, but it is initially quite hard to know how to work with them, especially when integrating. Here I show an alternative method for finding the integral of a hyperbola using first-month knowledge of high school Calculus. First, we start by proving that y = 1/x is a hyperbola. We will define a hyperbola as one having the general form: y^2 - x^2 = a. This can be done with polar equations or with Euler’s formula. In this case, I will show how to do it both ways to demonstrate how it can be done quickly or with basic knowledge.\nThis example uses polar coordinates to rotate a y = 1/x graph 45° or π/4 angle and arriving to y^2 - x^2 = 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolar Coordinate method\n\n\n\n\n |\n\n\nCalculating the specific areas:\nFrom the figure below, we can see two lines: one passing through y=x and another one labeled P. There are four areas labeled A, B, C, and D, these areas can be calculated through different equations. First, let’s solve the easiest ones: A and D.\n\n\n\nLabeled Areas\n\n\nA stays constant since it represents a triangle made from an isosceles triangle with a base and height of 1, which doesn’t depend on the position of line P.\nThe Area of D is ½P^2 since the triangle has a base and height equal to P.\nTo get the other two areas, we need to define the line going from 0,0 to the right-most corner of the triangle C as a new axis L. L has the length of the base of the original y=1x graph used, which allows us to get the area of that shape using a natural logarithm. The image below shows the point where L is measured from.\n\n\n\nPonit L\n\n\nBased on the image above. Area C, having a base on the x-axis in the original y = 1/x graph, makes it easier to calculate in terms of L for the rotated graph. We know that in the original y = 1/x graph the height of the triangle is y and it was formed by a 45° or π/4 angle, meaning that both lines LM and LN have the same length. Knowing that LN = y, we can determine the area to be equal to ½(1/L)^2 since both the base and height in the rotated triangle need to be 1/L.\nWe also need to consider that L doesn’t lie exactly on P, meaning that we need to remove the segment LM from length L to get length P. Thankfully, we already know what LM is, meaning that we can create a formula to calculate P based on L. Using the quadratic formula, we can solve for L, giving us the last step in finding the integral of the hyperbola. We are using the positive variation in the quadratic formula since we will not account for the negative y-values on the graph.\n\n\n\nCalculating Area B\n\n\nAfter getting all of the formulas needed, it is now just adding them together. Note that the formula we are using is y = √(x^2+2), this was done because y^2 - x^2 = 2 is not a function, but it does graph the same curve for positive y values.\n\n\n\nFinal simplification"

Sometimes a specific rocket needs to collect different kinds of data and deploy stages based on different conditions other than time, acceleration, altitude, or other common triggers. This project focuses on making a cheap, customizable rocket avionics system that can be easily used and modified for different needs.\n\n\n\nDiagram describing data flow\n\n\n\n\nHandheld receiver and Tracker: The red LED will blink faster the closer you are pointing to the direction of where the rocket is. \n\n\nRadio Modules These modules now have LoRa designed antennas, meaning that the gain is much better. These antennas should work at a range of 10 miles, but it is currently not tested. \n\n\nOnboard Computer The red LED is to see the signals that would activate the parachute deployment. The purpose of this board is to send data, save data, and receive deployment orders from the handheld receiver. \n\n\nHow does the tracker work? The receiver will need 3 data points: GPS of rocket, GPS of itself, and Magnetometer data. This means that you can calculate the angle between where the rocket is and where the receiver is and check how closely it matches the magnetometer data, changing the blinking frequency. \n\n\nFuture development in the project: Although the project has gotten very good progress in data transmission, it is still missing to have everything soldered in a more permanent board. Most of the systems, other than the back and forth data transmission, have only been tested individually, this leaves the integration of these systems as another task. Currently, I am working in making a phone application that makes tracking easier."

Well, this is a question I had some time ago, which inspired me to test it on a video game controller, and eventually, a keyboard. The system here connects the circuit in a controller to some transistors using nails. The transistors can be switched on and off with the use of a microcontroller, which in this case is an Arduino Uno. The system done with the controller worked well and was able to be programmed. The project then started using a keyboard instead of a controller, which was proven to work. I was limited by the microcontroller I had available because the keyboard circuit had more terminals than the Arduino, meaning that not all letters and symbols could be simulated.\n\n\n\nDiagram showing Arduino connection to controller\n\n\n\n\nOriginal circuit of a computer keyboard. This circuit worked in an interesting way, where terminals were either type A or B (8A and 18B in total). A and B are able to combine to create different key presses, adding to 144 different possible keys (including letters, symbols, turning your computer off, and more). One interesting hidden key printed the current date and time in just one press. The explanation of how this works explains why when you press “a” and “d” at the same time it will no longer detect when you press “c” (this may vary from keyboard to keyboard), but it does detect when you press “h”. This is because “a” and ”d”, already include the combinations which “c” needs to be detected by the computer (“a” may have the same A terminal than “c” while “d” has the same B terminal as “c”, meaning that pressing “c” doesn’t connect anything that wasn’t connected before). \n\n\nConnecting wires to keyboard PCB Here is the set up used to connect the keyboard circuit. Note that there are a lot of wires coming out of this device when compared to the controller. In this setup, red wires are A type while black wires are B type.   Connecting wires to controller PCB Here is a closer look at the connections made with nails to the controller circuit. These connections only worked because the PCB is single layered. Overall these connections were effective for connecting the plates without the use of soldering since soldering frequently broke off the flat surface."

Altough the rocket crashed, it is unclear if it was the avionics or recovery that failed, but it is more likely it would have been the avionics since not even the nosecone was able to deploy, which should be directly liable on the avionics. All of this was analysed post flight and noted for the next year in the project, where they were able to get a working recovery system. At the end of the day, having a system you can’t fully test work first time is difficult. Here is a short overview of the recovery system:\n\n\n\nRecovery system design\n\n\nThis system consisted of a dual deployment using only 1 parachute. Although we only have 1 parachute, we can make it act like 2 different sizes by using a technique called reefing, where we tie down the parachute so it is closed when it is deployed. This helps since it acts like a smaller parachute and then we can cut this line using our custom designed and built line cutters to fully open them. For this, we tested the line cutters before flight, which we can see in the video below:\n\n\nVideo\nLine cutter test\n\n\nFinally, this recovery system and the other components of the rocket were integrated, amking sure they all worked together in order to achieve the video shown, The rocket was 63kg dry mass and 95kg wet mass (with fuel and oxidizer), although designed to be 113kg: The rocket reached a total altitude over ground level of 18994 feet (5774 meters).\n\n\nVideo\nRocket Flight"
